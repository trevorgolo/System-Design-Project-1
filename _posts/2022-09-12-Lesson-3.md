<h1> Bootstrap & Framework <h1>

<h5>Lesson 3 went over Bootstrap and Framework. <br><br>
Bootstrap is a front-end, open-source framework designed to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create websites. These websites can be made from templates or from scratch, but in our case, we used templates and altered them to fit our tasks of the lesson. <br><br>

We also learned about framework, which is an installable software in which the user can implement the software into their IDE and build off of it, utilizing the tools that are given by the framework. This is especially helpful when making websites, as the framwork provides tools that would not be available to the base IDE. <br><br>

Along with Lesson 3, we were able to utilize our newfound knowledge to create a website of our own, using a template of our choosing. After choosing a template, we were given a set of instructions with which we had to alter the template to be more centralized towards us, and alter certain aspects using CSS and HTML.<h5>
