<h1> Git & GitHub <h1>
<h5>Lesson 1 discusses an introduction to Git and GitHub, showing the difference between the two. <br> <br>
Git is a software that is installed on your local
machine to manage your code by keeping track of its history,
uploading code changes to GitHub, and keeping everything under control
in a console that is easy to access. <br> <br>
On the other hand, GitHub is a cloud-hosted website in which
coders can create Git repositories to house code of nearly
any language, and can be opened to collaborators to
allow several people to work on the same project,
using Git to push their changes to the GitHub repository for
the world to see, unless the repository is designated as private. <br><br>
Along with Lesson 1, we completed Lab 1 which consisted of
learning how to use Git and GitHub, as well as learning
the basics of HTML and CSS, and combining what we've learned
by creating our first GitHub Page.<h5>
