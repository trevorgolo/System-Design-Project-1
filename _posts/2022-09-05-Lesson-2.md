<h1> Workflow <h1>
<h5>Lesson 2 revolves around setting up crucial softwares that are
needed for this class. These programs include an IDE to read and
write code, a terminal command line application to access
command line tools, as well as Git for interacting with
GitHub and keeping track of code versions. <br><br>

For an IDE, I chose Visual Studio Code because I have used it for a
while now and am comfortable with its layout and abilities. For a
terminal command line, I chose Windows Comamnd Prompt because
I am also familiar with the basic capabilities of this application. Lastly, I already had Git set up from the previous lesson! <br><br>

The tutorials included in Lesson 2 allow us to become more familiar
with how each piece of development. Each video goes in-depth
on the basic capabilities of each software, and their purpose
for which we can use them.<h5>
